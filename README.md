file_handling_python_script
This project is a simple Python program designed to demonstrate file reading, modification, and writing, along with basic error handling and user interaction.

# Description
The program:

Prompts the user to enter the full path of a text file.

Reads the content of the specified file.

Converts the content to uppercase as a sample transformation.

Writes the modified content to a new file named modified.txt.

Handles errors gracefully (e.g., if the file is not found or cannot be opened).

# Usage
Clone the repository:


https://github.com/y-hacks/pythonweek4_File-Handling-and-Exception-Handling-Assignment.git
cd python-file-handling-assignment
Run the Python script:
python filehandling.py


When prompted, paste the full path of the .txt file you want to modify.
Example (on Windows):
C:/Users/YourName/Downloads/sample_test_file.txt
The modified content will be saved in modified.txt in the same folder.
